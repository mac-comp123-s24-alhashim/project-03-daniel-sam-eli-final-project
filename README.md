# Spin It To Win It

Spin It To Win It is a game created by our group for a final project in our Computer Science that simulates a slot machine. The user begins with a set number of credits, and after betting a number and stopping the spin, the user gets a payout dependent on the images they get, like a real slot machine.

# Features

* A GUI that simulates a slot machine with a legend and buttons for user to use it.
  
* Buttons that allow the user to stop and start the rotation of the images and will return the payout after stopped.
  
* A series of images that connected to the values (see the legned) and rotate when the user starts the spin.
  
* A random quote from a series of quotes that are displayed below the buttons.
  
* Labels that keep track of the current credit and the payout the user got from the previous spin.
