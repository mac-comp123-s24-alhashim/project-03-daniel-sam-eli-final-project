## Description
We are creating a slot machine with random numbers and a GUI that allows the user to bet a certain amount of digital money to see if they can win the most money possible.

## Why We Chose This Project
We chose this project because we wanted to make something fun that we knew we would enjoy making. We considered other options, like making a virtual to-do list, but we thought a slot machine would be a more creative and enjoyable way to display the programming skills we’ve learned in class.

## The Inspiration Behind The Project
The inspiration behind our project came from us talking about possible ideas when Sam suggested that we do a slot machine. We thought it was a fun idea and we decided to base it on some slot machines we had seen in video games. Specifically, we’re planning to do one based on a Pokemon fan game.

## Implementation
Our rough implementation at the moment is that we’re going to need some modules to get started, like the random module, any images or GUI modules, and an interval timer that Eli found. We’re planning to use the random module to get a random chance to determine the result and use the interval timer to stop the random loop, like a real slot machine where it stops when you pull the lever, and we’ll use the images/GUI module to design the interface that the user will see. Aside from that, we plan to have Eli do the coding of the GUI and icons that pop up when the user wins the jackpot. We’ll have Sam code the random chance to determine the results, and we’re planning to use horizontal matches only unlike a typical slot machine, which has horizontal and diagonal matching. Sam will also code the calculations for the payout and scores. Daniel will code the appearance of the slot machine within the GUI and determine how we can rotate through the images which we’ll have to link the numbers to. Additionally, Daniel will code the input for how many credits the user wants to bet and possible GIFs within the GUI. Overall, our three-step plan will involve coding everything that we can without the GUI, implementing the GUI, and then adding some extra elements to it.
