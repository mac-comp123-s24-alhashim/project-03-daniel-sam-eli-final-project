# Spin It To Win It

Spin It To Win It is a game created by our group for a final project in our Computer Science that simulates a slot machine. The user begins with a set number of credits, and after betting a number and stopping the spin, the user gets a payout dependent on the images they get, like a real slot machine.

# Features

* A GUI that simulates a slot machine with a legend and buttons for user to use it.
  
* Buttons that allow the user to stop and start the rotation of the images and will return the payout after stopped.
  
* A series of images that connected to the values (see the legned) and rotate when the user starts the spin.
  
* A random quote from a series of quotes that are displayed below the buttons.
  
* Labels that keep track of the current credit and the payout the user got from the previous spin.

# Requirements

The user needs the following requirements:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pillow Package](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/)
* [Tkinter Package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)

# Demo

We've listed below videos showing demos for different results based on spins.
